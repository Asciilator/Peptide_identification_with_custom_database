    "Why we do this:\n",
    "The raw metagenomics database represents the most comprehensive snapshot of the microbial community present in the sample based on DNA sequencing. By comparing the taxa in our DIAMOND-based protein hits (from custom query databases) to this reference set, we can assess how well our metaproteomics-derived proteins reflect the underlying microbial composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the results imply:\n",
    "\n",
    "A high overlap indicates that the identified protein taxa are representative of the microbes in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A low overlap may suggest detection limitations, missing reference proteins, or differences between transcriptomic/proteomic activity and genomic presence.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we do this:\n",
    "We load both:\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file of unique taxa detected in the metagenomics DNA reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotated DIAMOND results which contain organism names from matched protein hits.\n",
